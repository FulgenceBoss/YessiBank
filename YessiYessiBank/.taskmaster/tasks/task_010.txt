# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Transaction History Screen (Screen 8)
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive transaction history with filtering and search capabilities
# Details:
1. Create TransactionHistoryScreen:
   - Chronological list of all transactions
   - Transaction type indicators (auto/manual)
   - Amount and date display
   - Status indicators (completed/pending/failed)
2. Implement history API:
   - GET /transactions/history with pagination
   - Query parameters for filtering (date range, type)
3. Add infinite scroll or pagination
4. Implement search and filter functionality
5. Add export functionality (CSV/PDF)
6. Include transaction details modal
7. Add empty state for new users

# Test Strategy:
Test pagination, filtering, search functionality, and transaction details. Verify performance with large transaction lists.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Transaction History List UI [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic transaction history screen UI with chronological list of transactions, including type indicators, amount, date display, and status indicators.
### Details:
Create a TransactionHistoryScreen component with a FlatList/RecyclerView to display transactions. Each transaction item should show: date, amount (with appropriate formatting), transaction type (auto/manual with icons), and status (completed/pending/failed with color coding). Include an empty state component for new users with no transaction history. Design should follow the app's style guide and be responsive.

## 2. Implement Transaction History API Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Connect the transaction history screen to the backend API with pagination support.
### Details:
Create a service to fetch transaction history data from GET /transactions/history endpoint. Implement pagination by passing appropriate query parameters (page number, page size). Handle loading states, API errors, and retry mechanisms. Cache fetched transactions to improve performance. Implement data models for transaction objects.

## 3. Add Infinite Scroll and Transaction Details Modal [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Implement infinite scroll functionality for the transaction list and a modal to display detailed transaction information.
### Details:
Enhance the transaction list to load more items when user scrolls to the bottom. Show loading indicators during data fetching. Create a transaction details modal that appears when a user taps on a transaction item. The modal should display all transaction details including ID, timestamp, description, category, payment method, and full status information. Implement smooth animations for modal transitions.

## 4. Implement Search and Filter Functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add search capabilities and filtering options for the transaction history.
### Details:
Create a search bar at the top of the screen. Implement filters for date range (with date pickers), transaction type, and status. Add filter chips/tags to show active filters. Update API requests to include search and filter parameters. Implement client-side filtering for already loaded transactions to improve responsiveness. Add clear filter button to reset all filters.

## 5. Add Export Functionality and Performance Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3, 10.4
### Description: Implement export options for transaction history and optimize overall performance.
### Details:
Add export buttons for CSV and PDF formats. Create services to generate these file formats from transaction data. Implement file saving functionality appropriate for the platform. For performance optimization: implement virtualized lists, add memoization for expensive calculations, optimize re-renders, implement proper data caching strategies, and add pull-to-refresh functionality for updating the transaction list.
