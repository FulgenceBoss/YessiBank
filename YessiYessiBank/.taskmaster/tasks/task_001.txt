# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Development Environment and Project Structure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Initialize React Native project with Expo framework, configure Redux Toolkit for state management, and setup Node.js backend with Express.js
# Details:
1. Initialize Expo React Native project: `npx create-expo-app YessiYessiBank --template`
2. Install Redux Toolkit: `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`
3. Setup backend: `npm init -y && npm install express cors helmet morgan dotenv`
4. Configure project structure:
   - /src/screens (for UI screens)
   - /src/store (Redux store)
   - /src/services (API calls)
   - /backend/routes
   - /backend/models
5. Setup environment variables for development/production
6. Configure ESLint and Prettier for code consistency

# Test Strategy:
Verify project builds successfully on both iOS and Android simulators. Test Redux store initialization and basic Express server startup.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize React Native Project with Expo [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new React Native project using Expo CLI and set up the initial application structure
### Details:
Run `npx create-expo-app YessiYessiBank --template` to initialize the project. Choose a blank template for maximum flexibility. After initialization, verify the project structure and ensure it runs correctly with `npx expo start`.

## 2. Install and Configure State Management Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Install Redux Toolkit and React Redux for state management, and set up the basic store configuration
### Details:
Run `npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux`. Create the Redux store in `/src/store/index.js` with a basic configuration. Set up a root reducer and configure the store with middleware. Wrap the main App component with Redux Provider in App.js.

## 3. Setup Node.js Backend with Express [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Initialize a Node.js backend project with Express.js and configure essential middleware
### Details:
In the project root, create a `/backend` directory. Run `npm init -y` inside it. Install dependencies with `npm install express cors helmet morgan dotenv`. Create `server.js` with basic Express configuration including middleware setup. Implement a simple health check endpoint at `/api/health`.

## 4. Create Project Folder Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Set up the organized folder structure for both frontend and backend components
### Details:
In the React Native project, create the following directories: `/src/screens`, `/src/components`, `/src/store`, `/src/services`, `/src/utils`, `/src/assets`. In the backend, create: `/backend/routes`, `/backend/controllers`, `/backend/models`, `/backend/middleware`, `/backend/config`. Add placeholder files (e.g., `.gitkeep`) to maintain empty directories in version control.

## 5. Configure Environment Variables and Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.3
### Description: Set up environment configuration for both frontend and backend to support different environments
### Details:
For the backend, create `.env` and `.env.example` files with configuration variables (DB connection, API keys, ports). For the React Native app, install `react-native-dotenv` and configure it in `babel.config.js`. Create environment-specific files (`.env.development`, `.env.production`). Add configuration for API base URLs, feature flags, and other environment-specific settings.

## 6. Setup Development Tools and Verification [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5
### Description: Configure code quality tools and perform verification testing of the complete environment
### Details:
Install and configure ESLint and Prettier with `npm install --save-dev eslint prettier eslint-config-prettier`. Create configuration files (`.eslintrc.js`, `.prettierrc`). Set up VS Code settings for the project. Configure Git hooks with Husky for pre-commit linting. Create npm scripts in package.json for common development tasks. Perform an end-to-end verification by running both frontend and backend simultaneously.
